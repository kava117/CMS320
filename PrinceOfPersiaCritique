1.The Platform
	MS-DOS
2.Game Mechanics
	Puzzle, movement, and action mechanics. The player has to navigate through the dungeons, avoid & deactivate traps, and fight enemies to progress the game.
3.Storytelling
	There is no dialogue (as far as I got in the game), so the game creates a narrative through its visuals. The intro cutscene shows the trapped princess, the vizier, and the hourglass, stressing the player has a limited amount of time to escape. 
4.Visual Design
	The visual design is pixelated but handmade and stylized. Thorough animations help the gameplay feel smoother and the design more immersive.
5.Game pacing
	The game feels slow to me because I have trouble getting past the first area, but I think this was intentional and does not take away from the experience.
6.Player engagement
	The game flashes the timer on screen to remind the player of the time limit, likely to encourage them to keep playing and try to escape.
7.Graphics and audio
	The graphics are clean, smooth, and the audio adds body to cutscenes, and helps to emphasize key actions (falling, stepping on pressure plates, dying, etc.).
